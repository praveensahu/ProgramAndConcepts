AWS S3 – Difficult Interview Questions and Answers

1)  Explain S3 consistency model changes and their impact. Answer:
    Amazon S3 now provides strong read-after-write consistency for PUT,
    DELETE, and LIST operations across all regions. Impact:

-   Applications no longer need additional consistency layers.
-   Removes need for EMRFS Consistent View or S3Guard.
-   Simplifies distributed system design.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

2)  How does S3 handle 11 9’s durability technically? Answer: S3
    automatically stores data redundantly across multiple Availability
    Zones within a region. It uses:

-   Data replication
-   Checksum validation
-   Automatic self-healing Durability (99.999999999%) means extremely
    low probability of data loss.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3)  Difference between S3 Replication and Backup? Answer: Replication:

-   Near real-time
-   Copies objects to another bucket (same or different region)
-   Requires versioning enabled

Backup: - Periodic snapshot - May involve AWS Backup or lifecycle
archiving - Not necessarily real-time

Replication is for DR. Backup is for recovery over time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

4)  Why would a user with full S3 access still get AccessDenied? Answer:
    Possible reasons:

-   Explicit Deny in bucket policy
-   Service Control Policy (SCP)
-   KMS key permission missing
-   Block Public Access enabled
-   Object owned by another AWS account
-   MFA Delete enabled

Explicit Deny always overrides Allow.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

5)  How does S3 pricing work? Answer: Pricing depends on:

-   Storage class
-   Storage size (GB/month)
-   PUT, GET, LIST requests
-   Data transfer out
-   Lifecycle transitions
-   Replication costs

S3 charges for both storage and requests.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

6)  What are S3 Access Points and when would you use them? Answer: S3
    Access Points provide unique endpoints with separate access
    policies. Used when:

-   Multiple teams access same bucket
-   Large-scale shared datasets
-   Need policy isolation per application

------------------------------------------------------------------------

7)  What is S3 Object Ownership and why is it important? Answer: Object
    Ownership controls whether bucket owner or object uploader owns the
    object. Options:

-   Bucket owner enforced (ACLs disabled)
-   Bucket owner preferred
-   Object writer

Important for cross-account uploads.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

8)  Explain multipart upload internals. Answer: Multipart upload:

-   Breaks large file into parts
-   Each part uploaded independently
-   S3 combines parts after completion Benefits:
-   Parallel uploads
-   Resume failed uploads
-   Better performance

Required for files > 5 GB.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

9)  What is the difference between SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, and SSE-C? Answer:
    SSE-S3:

-   AWS manages keys

SSE-KMS: - AWS KMS manages keys - Fine-grained access control -
Auditable via CloudTrail

SSE-C: - Customer provides encryption key - AWS does not store key

------------------------------------------------------------------------

10) How would you secure a highly sensitive S3 bucket in production?
    Answer:

-   Enable Block Public Access
-   Use least privilege IAM roles
-   Enable versioning
-   Enable Object Lock if required
-   Use SSE-KMS encryption
-   Enable CloudTrail logging
-   Restrict access using VPC endpoints
-   Enable access logging
-   Use bucket policies with explicit deny for public access

------------------------------------------------------------------------

11) Explain S3 lifecycle policy optimization strategy. Answer: Example
    strategy:

-   Move to Standard-IA after 30 days
-   Move to Glacier after 90 days
-   Delete after 365 days

Reduces storage cost while keeping data accessible when required.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

12) What happens if replication fails? Answer:

-   Replication status shows FAILED
-   Object not copied
-   CloudWatch metrics track replication
-   Must reprocess or fix IAM/KMS permissions

Replication requires: - Versioning enabled - Correct IAM role - KMS
permissions if encrypted

------------------------------------------------------------------------

13) Explain S3 request performance optimization techniques. Answer:

-   Use multipart upload
-   Use Transfer Acceleration
-   Distribute object keys (avoid hot partitions)
-   Use CloudFront for caching
-   Use parallel requests

------------------------------------------------------------------------

14) How does S3 integrate with event-driven architecture? Answer: S3 can
    trigger:

-   Lambda
-   SNS
-   SQS

Used for: - Image processing - Log processing - Data pipelines - ETL
workflows

------------------------------------------------------------------------

15) Design a highly available static website using S3. Answer:

-   Store static files in S3
-   Enable static website hosting
-   Use CloudFront CDN
-   Enable HTTPS via ACM
-   Configure Route53 DNS
-   Enable replication for DR
