AWS IAM – Advanced Interview Questions and Answers

1)  What happens when multiple IAM policies conflict?

AWS follows strict policy evaluation logic: - Explicit Deny always
wins - Then Explicit Allow - Otherwise Implicit Deny (default)

Evaluation order: - Service Control Policies (SCPs) - Resource-based
policies - Identity-based policies - Session policies - Permission
boundaries

Even if AdministratorAccess is attached, an explicit deny in SCP
overrides it.

2)  Difference between IAM Users and IAM Roles

IAM User: - Permanent identity - Long-term credentials - Used for
individuals

IAM Role: - Temporary identity - Uses STS temporary credentials - Used
for applications and cross-account access

3)  How does cross-account access work?

Requirements: - Trust policy in target account role - Permission policy
attached to role - Source principal must have sts:AssumeRole permission

Flow: - Source calls AssumeRole - STS returns temporary credentials -
Access granted based on role permissions

4)  What is a Permission Boundary?

A permission boundary sets maximum permissions for a user or role.
Effective permissions = Intersection of: - Identity policy - Permission
boundary - SCP

Used to prevent privilege escalation.

5)  Identity-based vs Resource-based policies

Identity-based: - Attached to users, groups, roles - Grants permissions
to act on resources

Resource-based: - Attached to resource (S3, Lambda, SQS) - Defines who
can access the resource

6)  How do you prevent privilege escalation?

-   Restrict iam:PassRole
-   Deny iam:* where not needed
-   Use permission boundaries
-   Apply SCP guardrails
-   Avoid wildcard permissions
-   Monitor via CloudTrail

7)  What is AWS STS?

Security Token Service provides: - Temporary credentials - Role
assumption - Federation support

Common APIs: - AssumeRole - AssumeRoleWithSAML -
AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity

8)  Difference between SCP and IAM Policy

SCP: - Organization-level - Restricts maximum permissions - Cannot grant
permissions

IAM Policy: - Account-level - Grants permissions

9)  How to debug AccessDeniedException?

-   Check CloudTrail logs
-   Check SCP
-   Check permission boundary
-   Check identity policy
-   Check resource policy
-   Use IAM Policy Simulator

10) IAM Best Practices

-   Never use root user
-   Enable MFA
-   Use roles instead of users
-   Apply least privilege
-   Rotate access keys
-   Avoid wildcard permissions
-   Enable logging and monitoring
