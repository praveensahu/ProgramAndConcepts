🔥 1. How does Route 53 achieve high availability at global scale?
✅ Answer:

Route 53 is a globally distributed authoritative DNS service with:

Anycast routing

Multiple edge DNS servers worldwide

Health checks + automatic failover

SLA-backed 100% availability (DNS service)

Deep Points (Staff Level):

Uses Anycast IPs → Same IP advertised from multiple edge locations.

DNS resolvers automatically route to nearest/healthy edge.

No single region dependency.

Data replication across multiple AWS regions.

Key Insight:
Even if an entire AWS region fails, DNS resolution continues globally.

🔥 2. Explain how Route 53 health checks actually work internally.
✅ Answer:

Health checks are external monitoring agents distributed globally.

They:

Send HTTP/HTTPS/TCP requests

Evaluate response codes / latency / string matching

Require quorum (majority healthy/unhealthy)

Integrate with CloudWatch alarms

Advanced Insight:

Health checks run outside your VPC

Failover decisions happen at DNS level

TTL impacts failover speed

DNS caching delays failover visibility

🔥 3. How would you design active-active multi-region failover using Route 53?
✅ Answer:

Use:

Latency-based routing

Health checks per region

Low TTL (30–60 sec)

Multi-region ALBs

Flow:

Client → Route 53 → Lowest latency healthy region → ALB → App

If region A fails:

Health check fails

Route 53 stops returning that IP

Traffic shifts to region B

Staff-Level Consideration:

Data consistency strategy (RDS global, DynamoDB global tables)

Session management (stateless or sticky?)

Avoid split-brain scenarios

🔥 4. Compare Latency vs Geolocation vs Geoproximity routing.
Latency-Based

Routes based on lowest measured latency

Dynamic

Geolocation

Based on user country/continent

Static mapping

Geoproximity

Based on geographic bias

Allows traffic shifting by weight

Staff Insight:

Latency ≠ physical proximity.
BGP routing may cause unexpected latency results.

🔥 5. What are DNS propagation myths vs reality in Route 53?
Myth:

"DNS changes take 24–48 hours"

Reality:

Propagation is immediate in Route 53

Delay comes from:

Resolver cache

Client cache

ISP TTL honoring

Staff Insight:

You cannot force resolvers to drop cache.
Low TTL before migration is key.

🔥 6. How does Route 53 Resolver differ from Public Hosted Zones?
Public Hosted Zone:

Internet-facing DNS

Route 53 Resolver:

Internal DNS resolution

Used for hybrid (on-prem ↔ AWS)

Supports inbound/outbound endpoints

Used in:

Hybrid cloud

Multi-account DNS architecture

🔥 7. How do you prevent DNS-based DDoS attacks?
Strategies:

Use Route 53 (built-in AWS Shield Standard)

Low TTL

Use AWS WAF + CloudFront

Avoid exposing origin IP

Use Alias records

Advanced:

Rate-limit health checks

Monitor NXDOMAIN spikes

🔥 8. What is split-horizon DNS and how is it implemented in Route 53?
Definition:

Same domain resolves differently internally vs externally.

Implementation:

Create Public Hosted Zone

Create Private Hosted Zone with same name

Attach private zone to VPC

Internal → Private IP
External → Public IP

🔥 9. Explain weighted routing use cases beyond canary releases.

Weighted routing can be used for:

A/B testing

Gradual migration

Multi-version API rollout

Cost-based traffic distribution

Multi-cloud traffic distribution

Staff insight:
Weights are DNS-level — not request-level.

🔥 10. What happens if health checks fail but the endpoint is actually healthy?
Possible Causes:

Firewall blocking health checker IPs

Rate limiting

TLS mismatch

Regional network issue

Staff answer:
Always validate from:

External monitor

Different geographies

CloudWatch logs

🔥 11. How does Route 53 handle consistency of DNS records globally?

Highly durable storage

Replicated control plane

Eventually consistent updates

Authoritative servers updated quickly

Control plane vs data plane separation is key.

🔥 12. Can Route 53 replace a Global Load Balancer?
Partially.

Route 53:

DNS-level routing

But not:

Connection-aware

Request-aware

Instant failover (TTL bound)

For advanced global LB → Use:

AWS Global Accelerator

Amazon CloudFront

🔥 13. How would you design DNS for a SaaS multi-tenant platform?

Options:

Wildcard DNS (*.example.com)

Customer-specific subdomains

Dedicated hosted zones per tenant

Private zones for internal microservices

Staff considerations:

Certificate automation

DNS automation

Tenant isolation

Delegation strategy

🔥 14. How does Alias record differ from CNAME?

Alias:

AWS-native

Works at zone apex

Free

Points to ALB, CloudFront, S3

CNAME:

Standard DNS

Cannot be root domain

Extra DNS lookup

🔥 15. What are failure modes of Route 53?

TTL caching delays failover

Health check false positives

Resolver misbehavior

ISP ignoring TTL

DNS poisoning risks (if DNSSEC not enabled)

🔥 16. Explain DNSSEC support in Route 53.

DNSSEC:

Cryptographic signature for DNS records

Prevents spoofing

Uses KSK and ZSK

Tradeoffs:

More complexity

Slightly increased response size

Requires registrar support

🔥 17. How do you migrate DNS between providers with zero downtime?

Steps:

Lower TTL (48 hrs before)

Sync records

Validate new provider

Switch NS records

Monitor propagation

🔥 18. What is the difference between NS delegation and subdomain delegation?

NS delegation:

Delegate child zone to another DNS provider

Used in:

Multi-account

Multi-team architecture

Cross-organization DNS ownership

🔥 19. Explain hybrid DNS architecture (On-prem + AWS).

Use:

Route 53 Resolver inbound endpoint

Route 53 Resolver outbound endpoint

Conditional forwarding

Flow:

On-prem → Resolver inbound → Private hosted zone
AWS → Outbound → On-prem DNS

🔥 20. What metrics would you monitor in a production DNS architecture?

Health check failure rate

NXDOMAIN rate

Resolver query logs

Latency per region

TTL misconfiguration

DNSSEC validation errors
