🚨 Core High-Priority Topics (Senior Java / Lead Backend)
🧠 1. System Design (THIS is your biggest scoring area)

You’re a lead — they expect architecture thinking.

Focus on:

High level design (HLD)

Low level design (LLD)

Back of the envelope estimation

Scalability strategies

Tradeoffs & decision making

Failure handling

Must be comfortable designing:

Rate limiter (you asked recently 👍)

Notification system

Distributed logging

URL shortener

Payment system

Order processing system

Distributed cache

Real-time data processing

👉 Expect deep follow-ups like:

how do you avoid duplicate processing?

how do you handle partial failures?

how do you handle retries without duplicates?

⚙️ 2. Microservices Architecture (Senior Level)

Not definitions — real-world problems.

Cover:

Service communication (sync vs async)

Saga pattern

Circuit breaker

Bulkhead (you asked recently 👍)

Event driven architecture

API Gateway patterns

Rate limiting (Redis implementation)

Idempotency

Distributed tracing

Contract testing

They WILL ask:

how do you version microservices?

deployment strategies?

rollback strategies?
(you already started these 👍)

☕ 3. Advanced Java (Interviewers go deep here)

Not syntax — internal behaviour.

Important areas:

JVM memory model

Garbage collection tuning

Threading & concurrency

CompletableFuture

Locks vs synchronized

Volatile vs Atomic

Thread pools

Deadlock prevention

Performance optimization

Also:

Java 8 streams internal working

Functional interfaces

Immutability

equals/hashCode contract

🌱 4. Spring Boot Deep Knowledge (NOT surface level)

Expect questions like:

Bean lifecycle

prototype injected into singleton (you asked 👍)

@Lookup

AOP internals

Transaction propagation

Isolation levels

Lazy loading pitfalls

Webflux vs MVC

Custom starters

Auto configuration

Senior interviews LOVE:

how spring boot starts internally

☁️ 5. Distributed Systems Concepts (VERY IMPORTANT)

CAP theorem

Consistency models (you asked S3 👍)

Leader election

Partition tolerance

Distributed locks

Eventual consistency

Exactly once vs at least once

Idempotency

Retry strategies

Backpressure

📦 6. Kafka / Messaging (You have this stack — MUST master)

Partition strategy

Consumer rebalancing

Offset management

Idempotent producer

Exactly once semantics

Dead letter queues

Ordering guarantees

Throughput tuning

🐳 7. Kubernetes & Cloud (Senior Expectations)

Pod lifecycle

Rolling updates

Blue/green deployments

Canary releases

Autoscaling

Readiness vs liveness

Service mesh basics

Multi region deployment

🔥 8. Performance & Production Debugging (VERY COMMON FOR LEADS)

They will ask:

Production issue you solved

Memory leak debugging

CPU spike analysis

Thread dump analysis

GC pause investigation

TPS bottleneck finding

🎯 Bonus Topics (Differentiate You from 90% Candidates)

Distributed caching strategies (Redis cluster)

Rate limiting architecture

Feature flags

Schema evolution

Observability (Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry)

Security (JWT, OAuth2 flows)
